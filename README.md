Pytest Appium Tests

# Appium
Appium is a framework that allows for both running tests that manipulate the unit and running tests that verify what users are seeing on the screen. This is done by setting up a server for the unit to communicate with, either through the command line or through a UI. This is how the majority of tests are run and verified on the unit.
